## 🚀 Quick Start

Here’s how to get things up and running:

### 🌀 Tailwind

```bash
python manage.py tailwind start
```
> Starts the Tailwind CSS engine. Gotta keep it fresh & styled 


## 🖥️ Run the Dev Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
> Fire up the Django dev server like it’s 2005 🔥


Feel free to fork, star, or just lurk 👀
